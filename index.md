# Hello There!

I'm Aarav, a sophomore majoring in Computer Science! I enjoy watching Netflix and travelling in my free time! I'm currently taking CSE110 to meet a core requirement for my major, and am completing this assignment towards the course!
I believe that I have *already* dealt with Headings and **text-styling**!

The other markdown file can be seen [here](README.md)

## Recent Quote
I also like going over interesting quotes from time to time, and one quote that I came across yesterday was:
> The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting - Sun Tzu

## Quoting Some Code
I would like to declare my age with the help of a variable assigned to my name, just to play around with the *quoting code* feature in Markdown.
```
int aarav = 20;
```

## Something that I read today
I wish to share an article that I read today on the topic, [The Next Solar Eclipse](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68768121)

## A New Thing I learned with Markdown
I have used Markdown in the past, but one feature that I've never encountered before is Task Lists! Some tasks relating to this course that I've set out for this week are as follows:

- [x] attend Tuesday Lecture
- [ ] attend Thursday Lecture
- [ ] meet team for CSE110 Group Project
